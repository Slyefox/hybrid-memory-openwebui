# Hybrid Memory XL tool for Open WebUI
**Author: Slye Fox | License: AGPL-3.0**

A powerful, production-ready autonomous memory management system for Open WebUI that significantly improves upon the built-in memory functionality through better relevance filtering, context tracking, and specialized tools for managing different types of data. Works with the built-in memory filter of Openweb UI v0.6.31+ but works best with the Hybrid Memory Filter.

##CRITICAL | PLEASE NOTE:##

The Hybrid Memory XL tool is designed to be used by the AI/ LLM with complete autonomy. Therefore, regular system memory backups are highly recommended (The AI/ LLM does not need permission to call the tool if the tool is available/ active and system prompt tool-call syntax is in place. Depending on your AI model, autonomy may need to be encouraged or discouraged in your system prompt. You may also choose to omit the tool call syntax from the system prompt entirely and provide calls to the AI on a case-by-case basis). Hybrid Memory XL contains multiple customizeable tools, filters and actions (described below) to facilitate AI memory. Customization is not required for functionality but is recommended for your use case (see below). Also, as Openweb UI uses the CPU for embeddings natively, the Hybrid Memory tool can become HIGHLY demanding on system resources depending on your settings. Hybrid Memory XL has been tested on Windows 10 with 64GB RAM/ 16GB VRAM, Windows 11 with 64GB RAM/ 32GB VRAM and OpenWebUI v0.6.31+. Recommend i7 13th Gen processor or newer (liquid cooling preferred) in combination with at least 32GB RAM and 24GB VRAM. DO NOT operate the Hybrid Memory tool without a system resource monitor (i.e. HWMonitor)!

## Quick Start

### Installation

1. **Copy the tool file:**
   - Place `Hybrid_Memory_XL.json` in your Open WebUI tools directory
   - Or upload via the Open WebUI admin interface (Settings ‚Üí Tools ‚Üí Upload)

2. **Optional but Recommended - Install the companion filter:**
   - The Hybrid Memory Filter works in the background to improve automatic memory storage
   - Without it, the tool still works but relies entirely on built-in filtering
   - Upload `Hybrid_Memory_Filter.json` if you have it

3. **Configure the valves** (optional):
   ```
   USE_MEMORY: true (default)
   DEBUG: false (set to true for troubleshooting)
   max_memories: 5 (results returned by get_relevant_memories)
   memory_length_cutoff: 200 (max characters per memory in results)
   memories_dist_max: 0.75 (relevance threshold, lower = stricter)
   ```

4. **Test it:**
   Ask your AI: "Store in memory: I prefer dark mode"
   Then ask: "What do you remember about my preferences?"

---

## Basic Usage Examples

### Storing Information
```
"Remember that I'm allergic to penicillin"
"Store this in memory: My favorite color is blue"
"Add to memory: I work at Tesla as a software engineer"
```

Your AI will use `add_specific_memory(memory_content="...")` automatically.

### Recalling Information
```
"What do you remember about my allergies?"
"Do you have any memories about my job?"
"What have I told you about my preferences?"
```

Your AI will use `get_relevant_memories(query="...")` automatically.

### Finding Memories with Context
```
"Search for 'coffee' in your memories with 100 words of context"
"Find all memories about my medical conditions and show surrounding conversation"
```

Your AI will use `search_memories_with_context(query="...", context_words=100)`.

### Deleting Incorrect Memories
```
"Delete the memory about my favorite color"
"Remove all memories containing 'old address'"
```

Your AI will use `delete_specific_memory(search_content="...")`.

**Storing a lab report:**
```
"Save this CBC lab report as chapter 1 of PatientName_Labs with metadata"

Tool call:
story_manager(
  action="save_chapter",
  story_name="PatientName_Labs",
  content="CBC Results: WBC 7.2, RBC 4.5, Hemoglobin 14.2...",
  metadata={"lab_date": "2025-10-24", "lab_type": "CBC", "physician": "Dr. Smith"}
)
```

**Updating a report (with data safety):**
```
"Update chapter 3 with corrected creatinine value"

Tool call:
story_manager(
  action="update_chapter",
  story_name="PatientName_Labs",
  chapter_number=3,
  content="Corrected: Creatinine 1.2 (was 1.5)..."
)
```
Note: Metadata is automatically preserved during updates.

**Retrieving all reports:**
```
"Get the full history of PatientName_Labs"

Tool call:
story_manager(action="get_full_story", story_name="PatientName_Labs")
```

**Searching for specific values:**
```
"Find all lab reports with elevated creatinine"

Tool call:
story_manager(
  action="search_story",
  story_name="PatientName_Labs",
  content="creatinine"
)
```

**Exporting for physician:**
```
"Export PatientName_Labs as a formatted report"

Tool call:
story_manager(
  action="export_for_physician",
  story_name="PatientName_Labs",
  metadata={"format": "markdown"}  # or "text" or "json"
)
```

### Creative Writing Example

Tool call:
story_manager(
  action="save_chapter",
  story_name="Quantum_Dreams",
  content="The laboratory hummed with anticipation as Dr. Chen prepared..."
)
```

**Continuing the story:**
```
"Write chapter 2 of Quantum Dreams"

AI will:
1. Call story_manager(action="get_full_story", story_name="Quantum_Dreams")
2. Read what exists
3. Generate new chapter
4. Call story_manager(action="save_chapter", ...) with new content
```

## Configuration & Customization

### Valve Settings Explained

**max_memories** (default: 5)
- Number of memories returned by `get_relevant_memories`
- Increase for broader recall (up to 30)
- Decrease for more focused results

**memory_length_cutoff** (default: 200)
- Max characters per memory in tool results
- Prevents overwhelming context window
- Increase if you need full memory content

**memories_dist_max** (default: 0.75)
- Semantic similarity threshold (0.0 to 1.0)
- Lower = stricter matching (e.g., 0.6)
- Higher = broader matching (e.g., 0.85)
- Adjust based on false positive rate

### For Medical Use
```
max_memories: 10 (need comprehensive recall)
memory_length_cutoff: 500 (full lab values)
memories_dist_max: 0.7 (strict relevance)
```

### For Casual Chat
```
max_memories: 3 (keep responses concise)
memory_length_cutoff: 150 (shorter snippets)
memories_dist_max: 0.8 (broader matching)
```

## Troubleshooting

### "No memories found" but I stored something
1. Check if memory filter is running (Ensure OWUI Memory (Experimental) is toggled "On")
2. Try using `add_specific_memory` manually
3. Lower `memories_dist_max` valve - might be filtering too strictly
4. Check DEBUG logs if valve is enabled

### Search returns irrelevant results
1. Lower `memories_dist_max` (e.g., from 0.75 to 0.65)
2. Use more specific search terms
3. Try `search_memories_with_context` for better accuracy
4. Run `deduplicate_memories` to clean up noise

### Story Manager chapter numbers are wrong
- Chapters auto-increment if `chapter_number` not specified
- Use `get_summary` to see actual chapter numbers
- Update with correct chapter number to fix

### Memory system feels slow
1. Run `clear_embedding_cache()` - safe operation that clears model cache
**Note: The embedding cache is shared with your entire system. Clearing the embedding cache with the Hybrid Tool will only clear OWUI embeddings and has no effect on embeddings by other UI's (i.e. LMStudio).
2. Check if you have thousands of memories - run `memory_health_check()`
3. Consider running `consolidate_memories()` to merge old data

### Tool doesn't appear in Open WebUI
1. Check Open WebUI version (requires v0.6.33+)
2. Restart Open WebUI after uploading
3. Check admin logs for Python errors
4. Verify file is valid JSON
5. Close and restart the Ollama server

## Best Practices

### For Personal Use
1. Let automatic memory storage work naturally
2. Use manual `add_specific_memory` for critical facts
3. Periodically run `deduplicate_memories` to clean up
4. Export memories monthly as backup

### For Medical Data
1. **Use Story Manager exclusively** - don't rely on automatic storage
2. Always include metadata (dates, physicians, lab types)
3. Keep backups: run `export_for_physician` after each update
4. Use descriptive story names: `PatientName_Labs`, `PatientName_Imaging`
5. Never rely solely on memory - keep airgapped backups

### For Creative Writing
1. Use Story Manager for serialized content
2. Call `get_full_story` before writing new chapters
3. Use `get_summary` to track progress
4. Export completed stories with `export_for_physician` (yes, works for any text)

### General Tips
- Be specific in your queries for better recall
- Use `search_memories_with_context` when you need to understand the full conversation
- Run `memory_health_check` if something feels off
- Check DEBUG logs (set valve to true) if troubleshooting
